# 📋 ToDo App — Full-Stack JWT Authorization with Role-Based Access

A full-stack ToDo application built using **Node.js**, **Express**, **Sequelize**, and **React (Vite)**. Features secure **JWT-based authentication** (cookies only), **role-based access control**, and a clean, scalable project structure.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ JWT Authentication (HTTP-only cookies)
- ✅ Role-based access control (User, Admin)
- ✅ CRUD operations for Tasks
- ✅ Status transitions: `pending`, `in progress`, `completed`
- ✅ Admin can view all users’ tasks
- ✅ Users can manage only their own tasks
- ✅ Protected routes (React + React Router)
- ✅ AuthContext to handle session on frontend
- ✅ Backend architecture with layers:
  - Controllers
  - Services
  - Repositories
  - DTOs, middlewares
- ✅ Input validation with Joi
- ✅ Auto-create initial admin on start
- ✅ Production-ready environment switching
- ✅ Clean UI using minimal custom styling

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Development Mode

#### Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

#### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

#### 🧪 Environment Variables

Create `.env` in `/backend`:

```env
//Example
SERVER_PORT=3000
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=12345
DB_NAME=mydb

JWT_SECRET=holiday
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=1d
INIT_ADMIN_PASSWORD=Admin12345

FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
NODE_ENV=development
```

---

### 📦 Production Mode

1. Build frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

2. Start backend in production:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

✅ Make sure `NODE_ENV=production` in `.env`  
✅ Vite will generate static files into `backend/public`
